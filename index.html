                <p>Many people never achieve their goals because they have too many toxic, negative, energy-draining people in their lives. And you have to have goals outside of your comfort zone that will challenge you, because, in order to do something you've never done you've got to become someone you've never been, and you've got to have a mentor who's experienced and has been there, done that. You've got to have someone who can see something in you that you can't see that, and can take you to a place that you can't go there by yourself. Being a Civil Engineer, I never knew that I could I be involved in entrepreneurship until I came across BETA Your Own Life Project. I took it upon me to expand my skills repertoire as an amateur entrepreneur. As per now, I get to uplift the youths in Kenya, Africa and around the world to turn to their creative ideas and skills to build corporations. I believe that with this project we can take them there. I am for BETA Your Own Life Project!</p>

But if you do not jump, your parachute will never open. If you are safe, you'll never soar. Along the way in this project, I began to realize that I am not the same person that I used to be. The things I used to tolerate have now become intolerable. Where I once battled and argued, I am now choosing to remain silent. I am beginning to understand the value of my voice and there are some situations that no longer deserve my time, energy and focus. That is how enthusiastic I am about this project.</p>

                <p>We are living in an age when flexibility and creativity are the keys to competitiveness. We should be seeking not just diversity but also the values in our differences. Yet too often we are operating from old stereotypes and fears. Conditions reflected in business, that fear or a sense of threat is often met with a desire to cling to traditional and safe patterns. Here, we find some and squash them. In fact the very thing that is needed is expansion of this project and inclusiveness to working with new ideas and new people who can help us discover more for ourselves. The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
                  Beta Own Your Life Project is an organization formed with the objective to touch all aspects of lives all over the world.

                  Working on BETA Own Your Life Project has been a blessing to me because I get to gather up my team, and through generous charitable works, get to uplift the vulnerable in the society.
